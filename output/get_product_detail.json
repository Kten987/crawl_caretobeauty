    "description": "DR. GRANDEL Beautygen Renew Eye &amp; Lip was specifically developed to care for the eye and lip areas. The eye area is particularly sensitive and as the skin is quite thin, it is more prone to the effects of stress, screens, and other damaging factors. The lip area equally tends to be where the first signs of aging are noticeable as, more than thin skin, by nature it has less collagen than other areas of the face. To help reduce fine lines and wrinkles in the eye and lip area, the formulation of this cream contains several active ingredients with anti-aging properties. First, sea lift, an active ingredient complex, plumps up the skin and leaves it visibly tighter and smoother, thus ensuring perfect contours. The snow algae extract also contributes to a youthful complexion by protecting the collagen fibers and increasing the elasticity of the skin. Furthermore, the use of peptides and silk acacia extract promotes the buildup of collagen and helps to further reduce wrinkles in volume and depth. The latter also smooths expression lines, common in the eye and lip areas. Also important to mention, this cream contains soft-focus pigments that optically reduce the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines.",
