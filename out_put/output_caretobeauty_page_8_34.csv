https://www.caretobeauty.com/us/coxir-vita-c-bright-eye-cream-30ml/,coxir,30ml,"coxir Vita C Bright Eye Cream 30ml (1.01floz) is an eye cream designed to hydrate and brighten the delicate eye area, targeting the common concern of dark circles. This cream's formula is infused with vitamin C, a powerful antioxidant known for its ability to protect the skin against free radical damage and enhance the skin's radiance. So, it works to illuminate dark circles, promoting a more energized and vibrant look. The benefits of vitamin C are amplified with the addition of vitamin E, another antioxidant that supports skin health by fighting off free radicals. This combination ensures the skin around the eyes remains resilient against environmental stressors. Last but not least, niacinamide further enhances the formula by addressing darkness under the eyes, thanks to its ability to target hyperpigmentation. It also helps improve the skin barrier, contributing to maintaining hydration and overall skin health.
In essence, this eye cream not only helps maintain hydrated skin but also helps energize and illuminate the eye area, delivering a more revitalized appearance.","Main Ingredients
