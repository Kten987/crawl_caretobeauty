Hemp Seed Oil is a great alternative solution for irritated skin, as it helps decrease inflammation while relieving discomfort and irritation and preventing itchiness and flakiness. Not only that but it is also ideal for hydrating tight or dry skin without clogging the pores due to its oil-controlling properties. Lastly, it also helps restore the skin barrier, thus maintaining the skin healthy and moisturized for longer;
Jojoba Oil is very similar to human sebum. Thus, it is able to regulate the skin&rsquo;s oil production while also moisturizing the skin either through direct absorption or by forming a thin non-greasy semi-occlusive layer on top of the skin. Moreover, it also boosts the skin&rsquo;s natural shine and adds a layer of protection against environmental damage;
Hyaluronic Acid is a restorative ingredient naturally found in the skin&rsquo;s connective tissue. It not only deeply hydrates the skin but also holds in moisture, plumping it up which, as a result, also helps reduce fine lines and wrinkles. In addition, it also stimulates collagen production.","How to use
