This brightening serum will not only help to visibly minimize the appearance of discoloration spots and blemish marks but also interrupt the look of future dark spots. The result is a more even skin tone. The formulation of this serum includes the patented CL302 Equalizer Technology in a more concentrated state.
This technology, a pair of two different complexes, is responsible for single-handedly targeting dark spots both by minimizing their appearance and preventing future ones. Among the ingredients that are part of this technology, we can find glucosamine, yeast extract, and salicylic acid. Glucosamine weakens the bonds that hold dead skin cells together thus encouraging their separation from the skin. All the while yeast extract breaks up the appearance of large clusters of pigments to make them less visible. Additionally, salicylic acid gently sloughs off the uppermost layers of the skin revealing fresh and more even-toned skin.
As for preventing future dark spots, this serum contains gyokuro and rice bran extracts that will soothe the appearance of the skin and minimize the appearance of future discoloration patches. Furthermore, a complex of olive squalene, barley extract, and wheat germ extract helps to nourish and replenish the skin for a comfortable feeling. Lastly, licorice extract, an anti-irritant, along with other antioxidants present in the formulation, helps to reduce the negative effects of stress on the skin.
Overall, this brightening serum will give the skin a whole new appearance by tackling multiple problems and their origins. Moreover, although powerful, this serum is still gentle enough to be suitable for all skin types.","Main Ingredients
